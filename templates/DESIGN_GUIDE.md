# Pretorin Brand Guidelines

**Version:** V1  
**Update Date:** 26 September, 2025  
**Overview:** This document outlines the brand strategy and assets for Pretorin, an AI-first platform focused on simplifying government security compliance. The brand emphasizes warmth, clarity, and trustworthiness to make complex processes approachable and reliable.

## Brand Strategy

### Design Principles
The design principles guide all visual and communicative elements to ensure consistency.

- **Warm**:  
  Offers a human take on modern tech. Uses warm colors and organic shadows to imply bright sunlight. Incorporates hand-drawn illustrations and icons for surprise, light, and levity. Employs first- and second-person language for direct engagement.

- **Clear**:  
  Prioritizes simplification and clarity. Layouts feature generous white space. Typography is clean and legible. Creates openness and scale with large elements (e.g., cropped 'P' mark) or small ones (e.g., Rome-bot in a corner).

- **Trustworthy**:  
  Builds safety in high-stakes scenarios. Playful but function-first; design steps aside when needed. Tone conveys expertise and transparency.

### Brand Positioning
Defines the purpose, insights, benefits, and reasons to believe in Pretorin.

- **Purpose**:  
  Respect the high security bar for government software deployment without making it miserable to use or develop. Leverage knowledge of challenges and technical expertise to lower barriers, ensuring government software doesn't suck.

- **Insight**:  
  "Government Compliance is intimidating, expensive, and time-consuming. I wish there was a better way to get it done, but I’m not willing to risk my budget or reputation on a solution that I don’t fully trust."

  Provides a clean, step-by-step workspace that translates complex requirements into clear tasks. Achieve, maintain, and prove compliance faster and easier.

- **Emotional Benefit**:  
  Users feel supported, confident, and in control—not overwhelmed or alone.

- **Reason to Believe**:  
  AI-first platform (not an add-on). Delivers real savings in time, money, and stress. Not a repackaged consultant model; it's the future of compliance.

## Brand Assets

### Toolbox
Overview of key assets that define the visual identity:

- **Logo**: Balances geometric shapes with memorable touches; 'P' forms an abstract Praetorian Guard helmet.  
- **Color**: Bright, daylight-inspired palette with Southwest flavors (gold, yellow, turquoise); warm gray as black alternative; white for contrast.  
- **Sunlight & Shadow Images**: Plant/leaf shadows add depth and energy, evoking sunlight; metaphorical or aesthetic.  
- **Iconography**: Hand-drawn icons in mascot style for visual interest and meaning reinforcement.  
- **Rome-bot**: Mascot for memory cue; brings humanity, joy, levity; visualizes concepts silently.  
- **Clear Type and Transparent Tone**: Lora and Work Sans typefaces for legibility and friendliness; tone is functional first, bold/relatable second.  
- **Taglines**: "Government software shouldn’t suck" / "We’re lowering barriers while raising the bar."

### Logo
Embodies AI-human collaboration: crisp yet warm. 'P' styled with 'cresta' like a Roman guard helm for strength/security. Rounded and straight edges create visual tension.

- **Usage Guidelines**:  
  - Ensure white space around logo.  
  - Wordmark must be legible; use 'P' monogram if space is tight.  
  - Light backgrounds: Gray Brown logo.  
  - Dark backgrounds: White logo.  
  - Highlight cresta in Warm Orange for attention (light/dark backgrounds).  
  - Place only on solid colors or simple images (e.g., shadow imagery).  

- **What Not to Do**:  
  - Don't use full wordmark in small spaces (use monogram).  
  - Don't place over illustrations or busy images.  
  - Don't use Light Turquoise or Gold for cresta (Warm Orange or match wordmark).  
  - Don't separate wordmark from cresta.  
  - Don't style full wordmark in Warm Orange, Light Turquoise, or Gold.  
  - Don't tilt the wordmark.

### Monogram
'P' extracted from logo as standalone. Big: graphic anchor; small: signature in tight spaces.

- **Two Uses**:  
  - Large 'P': Graphic element, not logo replacement.  
  - Small 'P': For tiny spaces (favicon, avatar, etc.).  

- **Using Large 'P'**:  
  - Always Warm Orange.  
  - On any brand color.  
  - Often bleeds off edges; ensure counter and descender visible, avoid awkward negatives.  
  - Mask shadow imagery into it for texture.  

- **Using Small 'P'**:  
  - Follow logo guidelines.  

### Color
Unique, energetic palette enabling clear communication. Inspired by Southwest landscape/art (Arizona HQ). White and Warm Gray for clean balance.

  - Dappled, organic leaf/plant shadows; soft/blurry edges (no hard lines).  
  - Gray, multiply mode, semi-transparent (opacity judgment; noticeable but not obstructive).  
  - Full bleed or fill shapes; no sharp edges.  
  - Ensure text legibility (lower opacity if needed).  
  - Add warmth, not drama; mood-focused, not illustrative.
